## Ready to Deploy

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push all changes
2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Should automatically deploy via existing connection
3. **Domain Check**: Verify sprouted.dev points to new deployment

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd ~/sprouted/sprouted-website
npm run build    # Test build locally
vercel --prod    # Deploy to production
```

## Testing Checklist

## What's Next

After successful deployment:

1. **Make Garden Repository Public** 
   - Go modules won't work until GitHub repo is public
   - Test `go get sprouted.dev/weather` after making public

2. **Create GitHub Releases**
   - Installation script needs releases with binaries
   - Use the Makefiles we created for cross-platform builds

3. **Monitor & Iterate**
   - Check analytics for user engagement
   - Monitor installation success rates
   - Gather feedback for improvements
