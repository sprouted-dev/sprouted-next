## Ready to Deploy

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push all changes
2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Should automatically deploy via existing connection
3. **Domain Check**: Verify sprouted.dev points to new deployment

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd ~/sprouted/sprouted-website
npm run build    # Test build locally
vercel --prod    # Deploy to production
```

## Testing Checklist

Once deployed, test these features:

### ✅ **Website Features**
- [ ] Site loads at https://sprouted.dev
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle works (if you have the toggle component)
- [ ] Rotating phrases animate correctly
- [ ] Weather demo section displays properly
- [ ] Installation commands are correct
- [ ] Email signup form works
- [ ] All links point to correct URLs

### ✅ **Go Module Features**
```bash
# Test Go module redirects
curl -H "User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1" "https://sprouted.dev/weather?go-get=1"
curl -H "User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1" "https://sprouted.dev/sprout-cli?go-get=1"

# Test installation script
curl -fsSL https://sprouted.dev/install.sh | head -10
```

### ✅ **Performance**
- [ ] Page loads in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] Images and animations smooth

## What's Next

After successful deployment:

1. **Make Garden Repository Public** 
   - Go modules won't work until GitHub repo is public
   - Test `go get sprouted.dev/weather` after making public

2. **Create GitHub Releases**
   - Installation script needs releases with binaries
   - Use the Makefiles we created for cross-platform builds

3. **Monitor & Iterate**
   - Check analytics for user engagement
   - Monitor installation success rates
   - Gather feedback for improvements
